# Link Battle MMO — backend MVP

NestJS coordinator server for the `gen1recomp` desktop prototype. Guest world
state remains in memory, while the PostgreSQL connection and schema are now
available for the persistent application slices described in the database
architecture.

## Startup

Requires Node.js 22 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

- HTTP: `http://localhost:3000/health` (includes a PostgreSQL readiness query)
- TCP: `localhost:7778`
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:7779`
- Required variable: `DATABASE_URL`
- Migration variable: `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` (falls back to `DATABASE_URL`)
- Optional database variables: `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`,
  `DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `DATABASE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and
  `DATABASE_ROLE` (defaults to the least-privilege `mmo_app` role)
- Network variables: `HTTP_PORT`, `TCP_PORT`, `WS_PORT`, and `HOST`

For local development, `docker compose up --build` starts PostgreSQL, applies
the ordered migrations, and starts the server. Migration credentials must be
able to create extensions and roles; application credentials should be limited
to `mmo_app` in deployed environments.

Each TCP message is a JSON object on a single line terminated by `\n`. On
WebSocket, each text frame contains exactly one JSON object, with no `\n` or
NDJSON. Both transports share the same protocol, coordinator, and world: a TCP
client can see and challenge a WebSocket client. The per-message limit is 64
KiB. The ROM and the save must not be uploaded to this service.

## Register an account

After applying the migrations, an operator or local user can create an account
with the command-line utility. The password is accepted only on standard input
so that it does not appear in shell history or the process list:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'a-long-unique-password' | npm run account:register -- \
  --username Red --email red@example.test --password-stdin
```

`DATABASE_URL` selects the database. Usernames are 3-32 ASCII letters, numbers,
or underscores; passwords are 12-128 UTF-8 bytes. Email is optional. Registration
inserts the account and its salted scrypt password verifier in one transaction,
and duplicate usernames or email addresses are reported without identifying
which field already exists. This utility deliberately does not expose a public
HTTP registration endpoint; public signup still requires rate limiting, abuse
controls, verification, and the privacy/operations review described in the
project security guidance.

## Presence flow

The first message must be:

```json
{"type":"join_world","name":"Red","mapId":"PALLET_TOWN","x":5,"y":6,"px":40,"py":48,"facing":"down","moving":false}
```

`x/y` are tile coordinates; `px/py` are optional and allow visual
interpolation. `facing` is `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right`.

The server replies with three messages. `welcome` + `snapshot` is the main
contract; `world_snapshot` is emitted as an aggregated message to ease early
clients:

```json
{"type":"welcome","playerId":"uuid","player":{"id":"uuid","name":"Red","mapId":"PALLET_TOWN","x":5,"y":6,"px":40,"py":48,"facing":"down","moving":false}}
{"type":"snapshot","mapId":"PALLET_TOWN","players":[]}
{"type":"world_snapshot","selfId":"uuid","mapId":"PALLET_TOWN","players":[]}
```

Incremental changes are `player_joined`, `player_moved`, and `player_left`.
Movement:

```json
{"type":"move","mapId":"PALLET_TOWN","x":6,"y":6,"px":48,"py":48,"facing":"right","moving":true,"seq":42}
```

When `mapId` changes, the server emits a leave on the previous map, an entry on
the new one, and a fresh snapshot to the player.

## Challenges and battle

```json
{"type":"challenge","targetId":"uuid"}
{"type":"challenge_received","challengeId":"uuid","from":{"id":"uuid","name":"Red"}}
{"type":"challenge_reply","challengeId":"uuid","accept":true}
```

If accepted, both receive the same `battleId` and `seed`; their roles differ:

```json
{"type":"battle_start","battleId":"uuid","role":"host","opponent":{"id":"uuid","name":"Blue"},"seed":123456789}
```

The server does not interpret the lockstep protocol. It only forwards `payload`
to the opponent:

```json
{"type":"battle_message","battleId":"uuid","payload":{"frame":12,"input":1}}
```

To end voluntarily: `{"type":"battle_end","battleId":"uuid"}`. Both receive
`battle_ended`. A clean disconnect cleans up presence, pending challenges, and
battles; the opponent receives `battle_ended` with reason
`opponent_disconnected`.

Other messages: `ping`/`pong`, `challenge_sent`, `challenge_declined`,
`challenge_cancelled`, and `error` (`code`, `message`). You can only challenge
someone connected to the same map, and each player can have at most one pending
challenge or active battle.

## Commands

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

The web client can connect directly to the WebSocket adapter. In production it
should be published behind TLS as `wss://`; TCP is kept for the desktop client.
